<h1>Ángel Prado Moreno</h1>
<img src="./Personal Pic.jpeg" height="150" alt="Angel´s personal profile picture"/>
<h2>Personal Summary:</h2>
<p>I describe myself as an enthusiastic, hardworking, and helpful individual worker, where my personal strengths include the ability to use my own initiative and to perform well as part of a team. I have a willing manner, good observation skills, and a trustworthy personality.

    Considering myself a natural team builder, I have proven my ability to create a positive effect by being part of a team due to my positive attitude towards others. I am proud of showing advanced communication skills gained through face-to-face service skills, customer direct service, student service, e-commerce contact service, etc.</p><p> I accept challenges positively, and I am always looking forward to learning new tasks and skills. This attitude provides me with personal and professional satisfaction, supports others, and builds positive working environments and successful results for the company where I work.
    
    I want to work hard to deliver the best possible service, improve the efficiency of my new role, and thrive in a new and different environment. All the successes in my career have been possible thanks to my background knowledge based on a bachelor’s degree in business management, which provides me with the ability to work in different business environments. This background knowledge, plus more than 17 years working in different company roles, has given me a wide range of professional experience and enabled me to work across a diverse range of project disciplines like project development as a business analyst (functional analyst), administration, finance, consulting, or customer service.
    
    </p><p>I can positively highlight, and this can be checked on my CV, that I could play an active part in one of the biggest independent tax administration bodies of Spain, called "Gestion Tributaria Territorial," where I started working for 4,5 years on the customer service side and, after successfully achieving the role and giving excellent customer service to the citizens, I was promoted to work at central services at company headquarters. Here I started a career in project application development in a consulting role, and at the same time I developed some knowledge and experience as a functional analyst, where I had to work next to councils and civil servants, sometimes even travelling to different cities around Spain to give support to civil servants administrators that attend to public at councils. Also, I can happily say that I decided to take a big step change in my life—the biggest challenge—by leaving my country and starting to live where my passion for nature and culture took me: Bristol. Here, I could start a career in finance (with no previous experience) as an accounts payable administrator and learn and work hard at the same time as dealing with the new challenges of a second language and a life abroad in your original country and within a new culture. I think this has proven my adaptability to changes, my capability to learn, and my constancy.</p>
